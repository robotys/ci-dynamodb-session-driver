# ci-dynamodb-session-driver
A DynamoDB session driver for CodeIgniter 3.x

## Usage

To use, simply specify to use DynamoDB for session storage in your configuration file.

Open your `application/config/config.php` and, set "dynamodb" to "sess_diriver"
on "Session Variables" section.
Also, set the table name that you will use to "sess_save_path".
The table you specified is need to create in advance.

```php
$config['sess_driver'] = 'dynamodb';
$config['sess_save_path'] = 'my_session';
```

### AWS access credentials
If you use EC2 and that instances are already given a IAM instance role,
you don't need to config any credentials for this library. Otherwise, you
need to set AWS access key and secret to your configuration file.

Open `application/config/sess_dynamo.php` and, set appropriate credentials to
"sess_dynamo_key" and "sess_dynamo_secret".

### DynamoDB Table
Please create DynamoDB Table first with table name = sess_save_path. For this example, go to DynamoDB > Table > Create Table and use table name 'my_session' and make sure the partition key = 'id' and key type 'string'. Otherwise it will not work.
